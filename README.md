# Sci-Bot ðŸ§ ðŸ’¬

Welcome to Sci-Bot, your intelligent companion for computer science-related questions! Sci-Bot is a chatbot developed using Python and Flask that provides answers to basic questions about computer science and can even learn from user interactions.

## Features
- **Question Answering:** Sci-Bot can answer basic questions related to computer science topics.
- **Interactive Learning:** If Sci-Bot encounters an unknown question, it can learn from user-provided answers and improve over time.
- **Accuracy:** The model behind Sci-Bot achieves approximately 82% accuracy in answering questions.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** The chat interface is intuitive and easy to use.

## How it Works
1. **Ask a Question:** Type your question into the chat interface and hit "Send".
2. **Get an Answer:** Sci-Bot will analyze your question and provide the best answer it knows.
3. **Teach Sci-Bot:** If Sci-Bot doesn't know the answer, you can teach it by providing the correct response.

## My Thought Process to Create This Bot
- Task was to create a NLP chatbot, so I decided to create one from scratch.
- Since the time limit was less, I could not develop and train a LLM.
- Using OpenAI or Hugging Face models cannot classify as something I made, since I will just use the API and the text document to answer questions.
